Richly detailed, hand-painted resource icons suitable for a strategy game, RPG, or boardgame-like experience.

- all icons are 128x128 pixels
- provided on a transparent background for maximum flexibility
- 48 icons (so far!)

Icons include various metals, foods, food sources, natural resources, and a few crafted goods. Feel free to email me and suggest more icons if you have any ideas! I have a few myself and plan to extend this icon set as well as expand into doing icons for some other themes.

Icons are provied both as icons in individual files and as a sheet. I've also included a sheet with a slight sharpen filter added in case you like the look of it.
